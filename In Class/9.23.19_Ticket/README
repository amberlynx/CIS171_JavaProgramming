To use the ticket class that I have created you need to know these variable names:

  For the total of the fine:           fine
  For the date the ticket was issued:  ticketDate
  For time that the ticket is overdue: overdue
  For the time the meter has:          meterTime
  
  There are gets set for all the outsourced information:
      getMake
      getModel 
      getColor
      getLicensePlateNum
      getMeterNum
      getMeterTime
      getPoliceName
      getPoliceBadge
